## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```csharp
// Inject the service
private readonly ISpeechRecognitionService _speechService;

// Single recognition
var result = await _speechService.RecognizeSpeechAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"You said: {result.Text}");

// Continuous recognition
_speechService.SpeechRecognized += (s, e) => ProcessCommand(e.Text);
await _speechService.StartListeningAsync(new SpeechRecognitionOptions 
{ 
    ContinuousRecognition = true 
});
```

### Advanced Configuration
```csharp
var options = new SpeechRecognitionOptions
{
    Language = "en-US",
    ContinuousRecognition = true,
    EnablePartialResults = true,
    MaxAlternatives = 3,
    SilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2),
    MaxListeningTime = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)
};

await _speechService.StartListeningAsync(options);
```

### Voice Command Processing
```csharp
private async void OnSpeechRecognized(object sender, SpeechRecognitionResult result)
{
    // Send to LLM for processing
    var response = await _llmService.SendMessageAsync(new ChatRequest
    {
        Message = result.Text
    });
    
    // Convert response to speech
    await _voiceService.GenerateSpeechAsync(response.Response);
}
```

## Testing and Validation

### Automatic Tests

- **Poor Accuracy**: Check microphone settings and background noise
- **Threading Issues**: Ensure UI updates on main thread

### Debug Information
Enable debug logging to see detailed recognition flow:
```csharp
builder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);
```

Use the included test runner to validate functionality:
```csharp
var testRunner = new SpeechRecognitionTestRunner(speechService, logger);
await testRunner.RunDiagnosticAsync();
```

## Conclusion
